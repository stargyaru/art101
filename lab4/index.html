			<h1>Challenges</h1>
			<p> we were challenged with using javascript, but found out that it was a little easier than expected. </p>
			<h1>Problems</h1>
			<p> We didn't really have any problems with this assignment, although we were wondering about the nested nature of steps doing psuedocode.</p>
			<h1>Results</h1>
      <p> We have a nice and clean page of psuedocode! </p>
	<h1>our psuedocode </h1>
	<pre> <code>
		//retrieve cup
		//retrieve eggs
		//retrieve fork
		//crack eggs (how many?) into cup
		    //stir with fork until blended
		//turn heat on pan
		//place butter into pan
		    //wait for butter to melt
		//place eggs from cup into pan
		    //wait until they are no longer liquid
		//remove from pan
</pre> </code>
