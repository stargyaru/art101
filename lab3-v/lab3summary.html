			<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>

			<p>The instruction in this lab was all about file structure, index, and file transfer.</p>

  		<h2> the difficulties we encountered</h2>

  		<p>It was a little difficult for us to comprehend the instructions at first. We were unsure what exactly was being asked of us,  but eventually, we got it.</p>

  		<h3> the results of our work</h3>

  		<p> We managed to create a cute, simple, and stylish website, with a few images and some hyperlinks. We created a bulleted list, and uploaded it onto GitHub, so anyone can visit it! <a href="https://crouton.net/">Wow!</a> The power of the internet sure is amazing...</p>
